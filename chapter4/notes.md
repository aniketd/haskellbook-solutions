# Basic Datatypes

Data declarations are how datatypes are defined

type constructor is the name of the type
data constructors are the values that inhabit the type they are defined in.

... I have no idea what that means ^

```
data Bool = False | True
     [1]    [2]  [3]  [4]
```

1. type constructor
2. data constructor for value False
3. Pipe | aka "or"
4. data constructor for value True

The whole thing is called a data declaration.
