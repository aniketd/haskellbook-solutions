-- 1. What is the type of myCar?
  -- myCar :: Vehicle

-- 2. Given the following, define the functions:
isCar :: Vehicle -> Bool
isCar (Car _ _) = True
isCar _ = False

isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool
isPlane (Plane _ _) = True
isPlane _ = False

areCars :: [Vehicle] -> [Bool]

-- 3. Now weâ€™re going to write a function to tell us the manufacturer
-- of a piece of data:

-- To make this safer I'm going to use Maybe
